STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  using Flaskapi and Mysql Python project BACKEND OPERATION

HI,
Project Title: 
STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  using Flaskapi and Mysql Python project BACKEND OPERATION
Primary Purpose: You enter the email and password in the login form.
sometime errors will be raised because your not correct email like you missing '@' symbol so display the error
example

import re
def validate_email(email):
# Regular expression pattern to match a valid email address
pattern = r'^[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+.\w+$'

if re.match(pattern, email):
    print("Valid email:", email)
else:
    print("Invalid email:", email)
Test cases
emails = [
"user@example.com",
"invalid-email",
"another.user@domain.co",
"no@tld.",
"name.lastname@subdomain.domain.com",
]

for email in emails:
validate_email(email)

def validate_password(password):
# Regular expression pattern to match a valid password
# This pattern requires at least 8 characters, including at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
pattern = r'^(?=.[a-z])(?=.[A-Z])(?=.\d)(?=.[@$!%?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%?&]{8,}$'

if re.match(pattern, password):
    print("Valid password",password)
else:
    print("Invalid password",password)
Test cases
passwords = [
"Passw0rd$",
"simple",
"12345678",
"P@ssw0rd",
"Complex123$",
"Auto@1224"
]


for password in passwords:
validate_password(password)

IMAGEUPLOAD.PYT

The code you've provided appears to be a Python Flask application for uploading and retrieving image data to/from a MySQL database. Below is a description of the main functionalities of the code:

Importing Necessary Modules: The code starts by importing the required Python modules, including datetime for handling date and time, os for operating system-related functionality, requests for handling HTTP requests, mysql.connector for interacting with a MySQL database, and Flask for creating a web application.

Database Configuration: The db_config dictionary contains the configuration settings for connecting to the MySQL database. It includes details such as the host, username, password, database name, and port.

Flask Application Setup: The Flask application is created and initialized.

Image Upload Endpoint ("/upload"):

This endpoint is used to upload image data along with metadata to the MySQL database.
It expects a POST request with form data that includes the following fields: Title, Author, Description, and Image_data (the image file).
The uploaded image is checked for its file type (PNG, JPG, or JPEG) and then read.
The image data is converted to a base64-encoded string and stored in the database along with metadata such as title, author, description, and the date of the post.
If successful, a JSON response is returned indicating that the image was uploaded successfully.
Image Retrieval Endpoint ("/get/<ID>"):

This endpoint is used to retrieve image and metadata from the database based on a specified ID.
It expects a GET request with the ID parameter in the URL.
The code queries the database for a record with the given ID and retrieves the image data and associated metadata.
If the record is found, a JSON response is returned containing the ID, title, author, description, date of post, and the image data in base64-encoded format.
If the record is not found, a JSON response indicates that the post was not found.
Database Connection Handling: The code properly handles database connections, ensuring that connections are closed after use, even in the event of exceptions.

Error Handling: The code includes error handling for database errors and other potential issues. If an error occurs, an appropriate JSON response with an error message is returned.

Main Execution: The Flask application is run with debugging enabled (debug=True) when the script is executed directly (i.e., not imported as a module).

Please note that certain parts of the code are commented out, such as the Google Cloud Storage-related code. If you intend to use Google Cloud Storage for storing images, you would need to uncomment and configure that part accordingly. Additionally, the code doesn't include security measures like input validation and authentication, which you should consider implementing for a production environment.
